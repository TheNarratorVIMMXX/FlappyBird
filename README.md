# 🎮 Game Overview
This is a complete recreation of the popular mobile game Flappy Bird, built from scratch using Python's Tkinter library for graphics and Pygame's mixer for audio.

### 🔹 Game Features

- Physics-based gameplay with gravity and jump mechanics
- Progressive difficulty - pipes move faster as score increases
- Collision detection system for realistic gameplay
- Sound effects for jumps, scoring, and game over
- Dynamic pipe generation with randomized heights
- Score tracking and display
- Game over screen with restart functionality

---

# 🎯 Gameplay Mechanics

### 🔹 Controls
- **Spacebar:** Make the bird jump
- **Reset Button:** Restart the game after game over

### 🔹 Objective
- Navigate the bird through gaps between pipes without hitting them or the ground/ceiling. Each successful pass through a pipe increases your score.

### 🔹 Difficulty Progression
- **Starting speed:** 10 pixels per frame
- Speed increases by 0.5 with each pipe cleared
- **Maximum speed cap:** 20 pixels per frame
- Pipe gap remains constant at 250 pixels

---

# 🚀 Features

### 🔹 ✨ Core Gameplay Features
- **Gravity System:** Realistic downward acceleration (5 pixels per frame)
- **Jump Mechanics:** -50 pixel vertical boost on spacebar press
- **Infinite Scrolling:** Pipes regenerate continuously with random heights
- **Collision Detection:** Precise hitbox detection for bird-pipe and bird-boundary collisions
- **Progressive Difficulty:** Speed increases with score

### 🔹 🎨 Visual Elements
- Custom sprites for bird and pipes
- Smooth animations at 50ms frame rate
- Dynamic pipe resizing based on random positioning
- Score display in real-time
- Game over screen with final score

### 🔹 🔊 Audio System
- **Swoosh sound:** Plays on each jump
- **Point sound:** Plays when passing through pipes
- **Hit sound:** Plays on collision
- **Die sound:** Plays on game over

# 📦 Requirements

- Python Libraries
- bashPython 3.x
- tkinter (included in standard Python installations)
- Pillow (PIL)
- pygame

### 🔹 Installation
bashpip install Pillow pygame

---

# 🎮 How to Run

### 🔹 Clone the repository:
- bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/flappy-bird-tkinter.git
- cd flappy-bird-tkinter

### 🔹 Ensure all assets are in place:
- Place bird and pipe images in imgs/ folder
- Place sound files in audio/ folder

### 🔹 Run the game:
- bashpython flappy_bird.py

---

# 📊 Scoring System

- +1 point for each pipe successfully passed
- Score displayed in real-time at top-left corner
- Final score shown on game over screen
- Speed bonus: Game gets progressively harder (max speed: 20)


# 🎨 Visual Design

### 🔹 Color Scheme
- Background: Sky Blue (#00bfff)
- Score Text: White with Arial Bold 30pt
- Game Over: Red with Arial Bold 40pt
- Final Score: White with Arial Bold 25pt
- Reset Button: Orange (#ff6b35) with white text

### 🔹 Sprite Management
- Bird sprite loaded with PIL and converted to PhotoImage
- Pipe sprite dynamically resized based on gap positioning
- Top pipe created by rotating base pipe 180°

---

# 🐛 Known Limitations

- Fixed 1000x600 window size (not resizable)
- Single-threaded game loop (blocking)
- No high score persistence
- No pause functionality
- Limited to keyboard input (no mouse click support)
